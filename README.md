# xp-toolset

## Introduction

This repository is a collection of simple scripts used in a local organization called XP Ã„ngelholm. These are structured to be used by people with limited technical abilities, therefore advanced tools such as applications are contained in seperate repositories.

## Scripts

### user-removal

These scripts are designed to be executed during startup and deletes user information to forcefully logout users of applications not affected by a similar process done by ggLeap.

### windows-profile-picture-removal

_windows-profile-picture-removal_ can be used to quickly remove profile pictures from computers with pictures due to people logging into Windows and Microsoft.

### installer-scripts

The scripts found in _installer-scripts_ are used to simplify the install process for the other scripts. A seperate folder is used instead of dividing the install scripts based on usage to simplify the main install script as well as enabling individual download.
